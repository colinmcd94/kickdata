## KickData: kickstarter data scraper

A Python applications deployed on Google App Engine with the
[Flask micro framework](http://flask.pocoo.org).

This is a Python scraper that you can easily launch in Google App Engine.  Follow the instructions below (written by Google, not by me) to launch.  You will need to set up a Parse database at [Parse.com](parse.com) and plug your API keys into the appropriate places in main.py.  IMPORTANT: call your database "Project" otherwise this will not work.

If you are a researcher and have no desire no set all this up, message me (colinmcd94) and I will export my own database and share it with you.


## Run Locally
1. Install the [App Engine Python SDK](https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads).
See the README file for directions. You'll need python 2.7 and [pip 1.4 or later](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html) installed too.

2. Clone this repo with

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-python-flask-skeleton.git
   ```
3. Install dependencies in the project's lib directory.
   Note: App Engine can only import libraries from inside your project directory.

   ```
   cd appengine-python-flask-skeleton
   pip install -r requirements.txt -t lib
   ```
   You also must download BeautifulSoup 3.2.1
4. Run this project locally from the command line:

   ```
   dev_appserver.py .
   ```

Visit the application [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

See [the development server documentation](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/devserver)
for options when running dev_appserver.

## Deploy
To deploy the application:

1. Use the [Admin Console](https://appengine.google.com) to create a
   project/app id. (App id and project id are identical)
1. [Deploy the
   application](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/uploadinganapp) with

   ```
   appcfg.py -A <your-project-id> --oauth2 update .
   ```
1. Congratulations!  Your application is now live at your-app-id.appspot.com

## Next Steps
This skeleton includes `TODO` markers to help you find basic areas you will want
to customize.

### Relational Databases and Datastore
To add persistence to your models, use
[NDB](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/ndb/) for
scale.  Consider
[CloudSQL](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/cloud-sql)
if you need a relational database.

### Installing Libraries
See the [Third party
libraries](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/libraries27)
page for libraries that are already included in the SDK.  To include SDK
libraries, add them in your app.yaml file. Other than libraries included in
the SDK, only pure python libraries may be added to an App Engine project.
